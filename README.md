Jokr.IO
=======

Jokr is a JavaScript library for easily creating user interface elements used in front-end web application development. It is easily themeable and features events that can be listened for in order to manipulate DOM elements as you would normally.

To create a simple user login form, you simply call the following method.

`var loginForm = new UserSignIn('Login', 'action_user.js').create();`

The first argument is the title applied to the top of the login form and the second is the file that will handle your POST request for user authentication.
